- Prepare to reset the project's updates.sh/sample_updates_3-5.sh. restart from pelanz... ...from scratch in an new folder 
- By using variables+calcs, enable the dev to use update number only once (or W3U itself identifying the update number!). Use a folder for updates and use them as individual files inspired by ShrdChn? so the dev snds "web3updater/w3u new update" and an new file is created with an increased number
-? Fix sync bug (or already fixed by the previous item?)

- Enable the dev to choose the chain from where getting updates. Yes, ENS works only at Ethereum; but while ENS don't go multichain yet, enable the dev to use Polygon's PNS and other similar
